### Problem Statement: Hollow Pyramid Printing with Recursion

You are tasked with creating a program that generates a hollow pyramid using integers from 1 to a given non-negative integer `n`. The pyramid must be formed using recursion exclusively.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= n <= 100`

# Example Output for n = 5

```
     1
    1 2
   1   3
  1     4
 1 2 3 4 5
```  

**Note:** Implement the solution using recursion exclusively; any form of iterative statement is prohibited.

**Input Format:**
- A single non-negative integer `n` representing the height of the pyramid.

**Output Format:**
- Display the hollow pyramid pattern according to the given input.

You are required to design an algorithm using recursion to accomplish this task.
