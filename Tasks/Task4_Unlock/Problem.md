**PROBLEM STATEMENT:**

You are given a treasury and key to this are five integer. In this treasury there are 30 massive points. To get those points you need to recognize the pattern. Given first number write code to output those 5 numbers.Number can be large so output number after taking modulo 10^9+7.

**INPUT FORMAT:**

The First line of input is an integer **T**. The number of the test case.

For Each of the test cases:

- First line contains one integer n.

**OUTPUT FORMAT**:

For each test case output all five number.

**SAMPLE INPUT**: </br>
