Explaination

It can be proved mathematically that he has to score as maximum marks in subject in which topper has less marks. 
Because in the subject where topper scores less marks even increase in numerator results in more increment due to denominator is small.
So we let us assume sum of agrim scores be S and t2>t1. So we can calculate maximum scorable cg on this sum by giving minimum marks to 
subject in which topper has scored more marks. Both subjects must have atleast 30 marks so if (S-30) is greater than t2 the we will increase 
the marks in t1 subject because scoring more marks than topper will result in no increase in cg. No we will apply binary search on S because 
if 7.5 cg is scorable on some S then it will definitely be scorable >=S.
