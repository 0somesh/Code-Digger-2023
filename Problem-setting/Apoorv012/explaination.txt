Explaination:
The provided C++ code defines a function, "isValidIPv4", to determine whether a given string represents a valid IPv4 address. The function employs a while loop to iterate through segments separated by dots, checking for validity based on specific criteria. It ensures that each segment is not empty, doesn't start with a leading zero, and is within the valid range of 0 to 255. The count of valid segments is maintained, and the function returns true only if exactly four valid segments are found, indicating a valid IPv4 address. The main function takes user input for an IPv4 address, calls the validation function, and outputs "true" or "false" accordingly. Note that the code assumes well-formed input following IPv4 address rules but does not handle cases involving leading or trailing spaces.
