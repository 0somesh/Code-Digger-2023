# The Network Guardians

Once upon a time, in the digital realm of Cyberlandia, there existed a group of powerful Network Guardians. These guardians were responsible for maintaining the stability and security of the vast network that connected all the inhabitants of Cyberlandia. Among them was the mighty Validator, who ensured the integrity of communication by validating IP addresses.

## The Challenge

One day, the Validator encountered a challenge. A mysterious set of messages was being transmitted across Cyberlandia, and some of them claimed to be from trusted sources, while others seemed dubious. The Validator decided to create a mechanism to filter out the impostors by checking the validity of their claimed IPv4 addresses.

The Validator's challenge was to create a function that would determine whether a given string represented a valid IPv4 address. The function needed to return `true` if the input was a valid IPv4 address and `false` otherwise.

To succeed in this quest, the aspiring programmers had to consider the following rules:

1. An IPv4 address is a string consisting of four numbers separated by dots (e.g., `192.168.1.1`).
2. Each number in the address must be between 0 and 255, inclusive.
3. Numbers should not contain leading zeros, except for the number 0 itself.
4. The dots must be placed correctly, and there should be exactly three dots in the address.
5. No other characters are allowed in the address.

Could you help the Validator with this problem by creating a function that would determine if the given IPv4 address is valid or not? Thanking you in advance and wishing you a good luck for your future endevour.
