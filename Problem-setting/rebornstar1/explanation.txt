// There could be two different Approaches 
Iterative 
Binary Search (Optimal)

Most Important keypoint for this question is to know that the r-nary number canâ€™t be more than 100 or 200. 
When there are only 100 to 200 iterations to check then the time complexity will be O(10^2*10)
So by checking the iteration itself the answer is possible
If we use binary search here then time complexity will be O(log(10^2)*10) which is the more optimal Approach
