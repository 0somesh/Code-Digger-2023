JOHN REACHES HOME


Problem Statement:

John is a busy traveler who lives away from home. He finally decides to go home which is ‘n’ units away from his current location. He has a bike which will be used for his transportation. Due to the decay in battery , the distance it can travel is reduced by a factor of 'x' before stopping. If the bike stops it needs to be restarted, otherwise if the battery has completely decayed , he would have to start walking. Initially it can travel a distance of 'a' units without stopping. If he cannot , what is the extra distance he needs to walk(nearest integer).


Input:
The first line of input contains ‘t’ , i.e. the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of 3 integers ‘n’ , ‘a’ and ‘x’.

Output:
Each line of output should contain either a “YES” or a “NO”.
Each “NO” should be accompanied by the extra distance he needs to travel.

Constraints:
0<=n<=1e5
0<=a<=1e5
1<x<1e5
