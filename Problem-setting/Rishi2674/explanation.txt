Explanation:

The problem clearly states that it can initially travel a distance of 'a' units before travelling.The distance it can travel reduces by a constant factor x. It is clearly visible the distance travelled between two intervals forms an infinite decreasing GP. If the sum of gp is greater than 'n' he can reach his home , otherwise he cannot.
